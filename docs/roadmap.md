# Roadmap

The goal for the core tool was to create a shared, highly usable tool for researchers to view arbitrary types of images and make use of promptable segmentation model for interactive segmentation.

This goal was reached with the v0-beta version of the tool in October 2025. 

The next step is to roll out the tool to researchers involved with the [BZKF lighthouse on local therapies](https://bzkf.de/f/forschung/leuchttuerme/lokale-therapien/). Additonally, we will work on a study to evaluate AI-assisted segmentation of GTVs in MRgRT in a clinical setting. Finally, there are a number of additonal features that are planned to be added to the tool.

To tool is open-source and for the time being any PRs are welcome. If you want to contribute by adding support for your own machine learning model, please reach out to us or read the [developer guide]().

## Study on AI-assisted segmentation in MRgRT

We plan to conduct a study to evaluate the impact of AI-assisted segmentation on the efficiency and accuracy of segmentation tasks in MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT). The study will involve clinicians and others using the tool for segmentation tasks, with and without AI assistance, to assess improvements in workflow and outcomes.

Reach out to us if you are interested in participating in this study.

## Planned Features

### Work-in-progress
- Documentation, including a developer guide for adding new models

### Near term
- Automatic loading of models from huggingface

### Mid term

- A custom windowing plugin for the core-tool is planned
- Integration of more machine learning models, including models for specific organs or pathologies


### Stretch
