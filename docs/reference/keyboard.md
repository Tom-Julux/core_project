Napari (and the plugins of the core-tool) support a variety of keyboard shortcuts to enhance your workflow. Using them will greatly accelerate your usage of the tool, but are not required.

## Core Tool Shortcuts
For the core tool plugins, each shortcuts listed next to the UI-Element next to the corresponding action. Examples include:

- **Add new label**: `N`

## Napari Shortcuts

The napari viewer itself also supports a variety of keyboard shortcuts. They are mostly also tied to UI elements and can be discoverd by hovering with the pointer over any given UI element.

The most useful shortcuts (for the purpose of interactive segmentation) include:

- **Switching between the tools**: "Number keys" (1-9)



> Tip: You can also customize the shortcuts in napari to your liking in the [napari preferences menu](https://napari.org/dev/guides/preferences.html#shortcuts-settings).
