# Multi-Object Mode

The Multi-Object Mode allows you to segment multiple objects within the same image layer. This feature is particularly useful for complex images with multiple regions of interest.

## How to Use Multi-Object Mode

1. **Enable Multi-Object Mode**:
   - Locate the "Multi-Object Mode" checkbox in the Base Widget UI.
   - Check the box to enable the mode.

2. **Add Prompts for Each Object**:
   - Use the toolbar to add points, bounding boxes, or masks for each object.
   - Ensure that prompts for different objects do not overlap.

3. **Run Predictions**:
   - Click the "Predict" button to generate segmentation results for all objects.

4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Use the Preview Layer to review the segmentation results.
   - Adjust prompts as needed and re-run predictions.
